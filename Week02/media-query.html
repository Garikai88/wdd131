            <h2>Moroni 10: 3-5</h2>
            <p>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been to the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall recieve these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</p>
            <p>And when ye shall recieve these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shal ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things</p>
